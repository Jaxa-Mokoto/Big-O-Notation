O(n) = Linear Time.
It is common to see this notation in most algorithms defined today.
O(n) states defines a linear relationship between the Elements and the # of operations to be executed (i.e. a single for-loop)


Question:

// What is the Big O of the below function? (Hint, you may want to go line by line)
function funChallenge(input) {
  let a = 10;
  a = 50 + 3;

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    anotherFunction();
    let stranger = true;
    a++;
  }
  return a;
}

Answer = O(n)
Reasoning: as the number of elements increase in the input (i.e. length in this case), there will be a linear proportion of operations required to execute in the loop
